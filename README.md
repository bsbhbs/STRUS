# STRUS
UAV swarms have become a vital vehicle for sup-
porting distributed perception, collaborative decision-making,
and task execution in edge computing. However, they face increas-
ingly severe cybersecurity threats, with FDI attacks potentially
causing UAVs to lose control or even crash. Existing research pri-
marily focuses on anomaly detection or compensation tasks at the
individual UAV level, lacking a unified mechanism for detection,
determination, and compensation. Furthermore, it struggles to
adapt to the computational resource constraints and complex
spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in UAV swarm scenarios.
To address this, this paper proposes STRUS, a lightweight
dynamic spatiotemporal joint security detection framework. For
the first time, it constructs a dynamic spatiotemporal topology of
the swarm, leveraging dynamic graph convolutions and temporal
convolutions to jointly model spatiotemporal correlations within
the swarm. This approach breaks through traditional feature
modeling based solely on temporal sequences. A lightweight
multi-task joint mechanism is employed to achieve collaborative
optimization of detection, determination, and compensation. Fur-
thermore, to address knowledge forgetting in multi-task learning,
an experience replay mechanism sensitive to multi-task learning
is designed to enhance continuous learning capabilities. Extensive
simulations and real flight experiments demonstrate that STRUS
exhibits significant advantages in detection performance, attack
defense effectiveness, and resource efficiency.
